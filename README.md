Mod for [Abiotic Factor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/) that lets you specify a multiplier for item drops from resource nodes (eg. tech scrap calculators, PCs, crates).<br/>
You can set a global multiplier (unknown if this would allow any dupe exploits) or set multipliers for individual loot tables.

Requires [UE4SS for Abiotic Factor](https://www.nexusmods.com/abioticfactor/mods/35)<br/>
After you have that set up, download & unzip the mod zip and copy the ResourceMultiplier folder (which has Scripts/ and enabled.txt directly in it) into /AbioticFactor/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/Mods/

By default, everything defaults to 1.0x so you should see no difference.<br/>
You can configure the mod by going into Scripts/main.lua and editing the variables at the top (explained more in comments).

I haven't tried it in multiplayer yet so idk what will happen! I'll test it eventually but in the meantime if you try it lmk!
